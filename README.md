# Trash classification

I have developped Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to classify Trash images using keras as a Deep Learning library with Tensorflow as backend, this system is designed to classify glass from plastic where this smart system can be used as a machine's engine.  The pipeline of the model is as follows:

- First step is: the imports

- Second step is: data collection

- third step is: data preparation

- fourth step is data normalization

- fifth step is data tranformation and augmentation

- sixth step is: defining the model

- seventh step is: compiling the created model, thus this model will become as a computaional graph

- eighth step: after doing all above steps, we can start the model training

- the last step is model evaluation

After aplying only all the above steps, we have obtained a test accuracy = 0.91, and a test loss = 0.28

# Dataset

- The dataset has six classes: glass, paper, cardboard, plastic, metal, and trash. Where the original dataset consists of 2527 images, in this project, I used only 501 glass images, and 482 plastic images.

- The modified dataset can be downloaded from https://bit.ly/3mcb3aS

# Usage

- Download the dataset

- Download source code files 'Trash-classification'

- Install Anaconda then launch Spyder

- Paste the source code

- Train the model

- Test the model
