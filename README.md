# Trash classification

I have developped Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to classify Trash images using keras as a Deep Learning library with Tensorflow as backend, this system is designed to classify glass from plastic where this smart system can be used as a machine's engine.  The pipeline of the model is as follows:

*First step is: the imports
*Second step is: data collection
*third step is: data preparation
*fourth step is data normalization
*fifth step is data tranformation and augmentation
*sixth step is: to define the model
*seventh step is: to compile the created model, thus this model will become as a computaional graph
*eighth step: after doing all above steps, we can start the model training
*the last step is model evaluation

After aplying only all the above steps, we have obtained a test accuracy = 0.91, and a test loss = 0.28
