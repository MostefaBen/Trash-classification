# Trash classification

I have developped Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to classify Trash images using keras as a Deep Learning library with Tensorflow as backend, this systeme is designed to classify glass from plastic where this smart system can be used as a machine's engine.  The pipeline of the is model as follows:

First step is: the imports
Second step is: data collection
third step is: data preparation
fourth step is data normalization
fifth step is data tranformation
sixth step is: to define the model
seventh step is: to compile the created model, thus this model will become as a computaional graph
eighth step: after doing all above steps, we can start the model training
the last step is model evaluation
After aplying only all the above steps, we have obtained a test accuracy = 0.905, and a test loss = 0.284
