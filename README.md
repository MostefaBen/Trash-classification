# Trash classification

I have developped Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to classify Trash images using keras as a Deep Learning library with Tensorflow as backend, this system is designed to classify glass from plastic where this smart system can be used as a machine's engine.  The pipeline of the model is as follows:

##1 First step is: the imports

##2 Second step is: data collection

##3 third step is: data preparation

##4 fourth step is data normalization

##5 fifth step is data tranformation and augmentation

##6 sixth step is: defining the model

##7 seventh step is: compiling the created model, thus this model will become as a computaional graph

##8 eighth step: after doing all above steps, we can start the model training

##9 the last step is model evaluation

After aplying only all the above steps, we have obtained a test accuracy = 0.91, and a test loss = 0.28

# Dataset

##1 The dataset has six classes: glass, paper, cardboard, plastic, metal, and trash. Where the original dataset consists of 2527 images, in this project, I used only 501 glass images, and 482 plastic images.

##2 The modified dataset can be downloaded from https://bit.ly/3mcb3aS

# Usage

##1 Download the dataset

##2 Download source code files 'Trash-classification'

##2 Install Anaconda then launch Spyder

##4 Paste the source code

##5 Train the model

##6 Test the model
